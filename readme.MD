# Daily Dose 

We want to create an app that simplifies news digestion to help users avoid feeling overwhelmed by the constant flow of content. Our goal is to eliminate noise and allow users to concentrate on information that matters to them. By curating and condensing content, the app will save time and make news easier to process. Adding a social component for discussions will foster community, allowing users to share insights and engage in meaningful conversations around current events.
